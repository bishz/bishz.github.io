<h1>Recipes</h1>
 <p>In this space, I will be sharing my favourite recipes that I use everyday. I learned everything through experimenting while I was a student, through watching youtube videos and feeding my friends.</p>

<h2>Breakfast</h2>
 <p> These are very spicy (sometimes sweet) breakfast recipes that I usually eat with my boo. These include a variety of cuisines but mainly south asian with loads of inspiration from all over the world! We mainly just wing it :)

<h2>Lunch</h2>
 <p>I usually don’t eat lunch but sometimes I make dinner for lunch. But that usually means skipping dinner. However, there are a few things that we make when we are unemployed and feeling fancy so I will be sharing some fancy jacket potato and cheese toasties for our reference. And for Taha to have no excuses for not following the recipe. </p>

<h2>Dinner</h2>
 <p>We love dinner. This is what most of our meals consist of. That basically means we skip all meals and have a 1000 calorie meal and then I incessantly complain about not being able to sleep.</p>

<h2>Dessert</h2>
 <p> I only love dessert when I am on diet so we have loads of recipes. </p>
  <p> <a href=“#”>This</a> is our favourite dessert for now. </p>
